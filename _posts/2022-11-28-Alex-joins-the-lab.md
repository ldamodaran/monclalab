[Alex Voegele](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/team/AlexVoegele) joined the lab today as a research specialist. She is our first official, full-time lab member, and it's great to have her here! Alex just finished her degree in Biochemistry from Towson University, and will be working on developing a sequencing protocol for high path avian influenza viruses, and getting us going on a project looking at transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in urban and rural settings.
