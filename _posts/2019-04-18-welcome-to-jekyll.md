We are officially open! The Moncla lab opened its doors on September 1, 2022, in the Department of Pathobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. We are still very much getting set up, in both the wet and dry labs, but are excited to be here. If you'd like to stop by and say hi, please do! I'd love to chat about your science or ways we could work together. Stay posted for job ads. We'll be looking for students, post-docs, and technicians.
