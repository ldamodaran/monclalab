Natalie Hagan (MVP) and Maria Maltepes (Biology) joined the lab in January as rotation students. They will be rotating in the lab until late May/early June, and it's really fun to have them in the group! Natalie will be learning python and putting together a Nextstrain narrative to describe evolution and transmission during the ongoing H5Nx outbreak in North America. Maria will be exploring the evolution of non-human H3 influenza viruses, which are currently causing zoonotic infections and outbreak in dogs.
