Jordan Ort and Sonja Zolnoski joined the lab in January as rotation students in the [Microbiology, Virology, and Parasitology (MVP)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/camb/mvp.html) graduate program. They will be rotating in the lab until mid/late March, and we are so excited to have them in the group! Jordan will be working on finding mutations associated with H5N1 cross-species transmission, while Sonja is working on a mutation-based method for assigning H5 clades. You can check out their progress on our [lab github](https://github.com/moncla-lab).
