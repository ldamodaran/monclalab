## Bio 

I came to the Moncla laboratory after attending Towson University (‘22) where I studied Biochemistry. While at Towson I was an undergraduate researcher for a collaborative project between Towson University’s Departments of Biology and Chemistry studying short-chain fatty acid metabolites produced by microbiota. I have developed a passion for epidemiology and I am captivated by the power of bioinformatics to answer evolutionary questions. I am particularlyinterested in applying bioinformatics to elucidate viral transmission patterns. I am ecstatic to jointhe Moncla lab!
