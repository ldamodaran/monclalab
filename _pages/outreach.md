Saima Sidik from Nature News chatted with me about the ongoing H5N1 avian influenza outbreak that is happening in the US and Europe, which is causing devastating impacts on wild and domestic birds. We talked about why this outbreak is different from past outbreaks, and what we still need to learn about H5N1 going forward.

I had a great time doing this podcast with Vincent Racaniello and Nels Elde for their podcast This Week in Evolution [TWiEVO](https://www.microbe.tv/twievo/). We talked about our work looking at H5N1 cross-species transmission, SARS-CoV-2 within-host diversity, and mumps transmission in  Washington State, and swapped notes on the excellent ASV (American Society for Virology) meeting in July 2022 in Madison, WI.
