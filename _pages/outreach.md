__[A Bird Flu Pandemic Hovering on the Horizon](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/podcasts/naked-scientists-podcast/bird-flu-pandemic-hovering-horizon)__<br/>
I did an interview for the Naked Scientist (a BBC podcast series) on the ongoing avian influenza outbreak in North America, why it's distinct from past outbreaks, and what we should be thinking about going forward. Also featured in this are some of my all-time favorite virologists (Wendy Barclay!), giving great commentary.


### November 30, 2022: What is bird flu and how deadly is it?

I provided a quote for Helen Briggs, who was writing an article about the ongoing avian influenza outbreak for BBC News. The article discusses why this outbreak is distinct from past outbreaks, and possible reasons why this one is so widespread. 


### October 21, 2022: Why is bird flu so bad right now?

Saima Sidik from Nature News chatted with me about the ongoing H5N1 avian influenza outbreak that is happening in the US and Europe, which is causing devastating impacts on wild and domestic birds. We talked about why this outbreak is different from past outbreaks, and what we still need to learn about H5N1 going forward. 


### July 29, 2022: A podcast with TWiEVO!
__[TWiEVO 80: Viruses of a feather bottleneck together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcHmebKO_K4)__<br/>
I had a great time doing this podcast with Vincent Racaniello and Nels Elde for their podcast This Week in Evolution ([TWiEVO](https://www.microbe.tv/twievo/)). We talked about our work looking at H5N1 cross-species transmission, SARS-CoV-2 within-host diversity, and mumps transmission in  Washington State, and swapped notes on the excellent ASV (American Society for Virology) meeting in July 2022 in Madison, WI.
